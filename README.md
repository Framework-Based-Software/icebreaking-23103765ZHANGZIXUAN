# Introduction

Hi, Mt name is ZHANG ZIXUAN.I am a student in the Software Maintenance and Evolution course, where I am developing a deep understanding of modern software maintenance practices. This includes techniques for debugging, refactoring, and improving the performance of existing systems. I am particularly interested in learning how to work with legacy code, ensuring that older software remains functional, efficient, and adaptable to new requirements.

So far, I have gained insights into best practices for version control, code reviews, and automated testing, which are essential for maintaining software over time. I also look forward to working on real-world projects that involve maintaining and evolving software systems, as I believe hands-on experience is the best way to reinforce theoretical knowledge.

Fun fact: I love playing the guitar in my free time, which helps me relax and think creatively.

Course expectations: By the end of this course, I hope to become proficient in handling legacy systems, applying effective maintenance strategies, and contributing to the long-term sustainability of software projects.
